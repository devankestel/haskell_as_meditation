# My Haskell Meditation Practice

* I will...

  * Empty my mind of all previous coding knowledge in other languages, to ensure my focus on Haskell
  
  * Focus on Haskell as a journey, rather than a destination by...
  
    * Staying on the chosen path during my focused time
    * Refraining from keeping 'provable records' of my achievements / work 
    * Choosing repetition over novelty to gain understanding and enlightenment
    * Extending existing exercises to acquire deeper levels of knowledge
  
  * Eliminate distractions by putting away / turning off anything other than the task at hand
  
  * Stop my practice when my mind becomes saturated with new information, until I am again refreshed
  
  * Study Haskell for a duration between 15 minutes and 1 hour every day...
    
    * with one dedicated "Fingers to Keys" exercise at a time
    * with one dedicated "Reading for Understanding" exercise at a time
