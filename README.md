# Haskell As Meditation
An interactive journey to learning `Haskell` in increments of 15 minutes to 1 hour on a daily basis, with an emphasis on treating it with the same focus one would with guided meditation and the goal of achieving similar benefits.

What do I mean when I say interactive? This whole guide will be like a choose your own adventure book, except with markdowns which link to each other. The choice forks in the adventure will either have to do with different forks in the path due to a learner's personal prior experience with a topic/paradigm (or lack thereof) or forks that allow you to choose a preferred learning style where applicable. The bulk of the content on each markdown will be a links to vetted resources I have learned to use `Haskell` and instructions on how to take best advantage of those resources in a meditative style with the daily time allotment a learner has chosen. 

## Pre-Alpha
This guide is still in the pre-alpha phase. As such, the materials will be changing frequently and do not yet constitute a complete guide to becoming a `Haskell` expert. As of now, this guide **does not yet cover anything**, it is just a skeleton. 

Development list: 

Topic | Status
--- | --- 
README | In Process
Roadmap | Up Next

## Who is this guide for? 
* People who want to learn `Haskell` because they are curious and interested in pursuing a journey
* People who like free stuff (I will only link to free materials, unless there are no adequate free resources on a given topic)
* People at all levels of programming backgrounds from beginner to senior developer
* People who are willing to dedicate at least 15 minutes a day to Haskell as a part of a habit, or practice, as is called in the world of meditation

OK. This section is pretty boring and uninformative. The next section is far more informative, so read on.

## Who is this guide NOT for? 
* People who have an idea of "getting up to speed quickly" 
  * Speed is not the name of the game
* People who are interested in "being productive" 
  * There will be plenty of "fingers to keys" exercises to learn by doing, but there should be no specific goal toward building full apps or a portfolio off the bat 
* People who are not willing to empty their minds of all other programming knowledge as they learn `Haskell` 
  * This is a key part of the meditative process

## But, WHY? 

Many developers want to learn a purely functional language, like `Haskell`, but find themselves stumbling because they place certain expectations on productivity and try to rush through the materials as if they were learning a second or nth object oriented language, instead of remembering how slow it was to learn programming to begin with. I was one of those developers. I even started trying to learn languages that are a shortcut in some ways to learning `Haskell`, like `Elm` and `Elixir`, because I was looking for a more immediate path to shipping. It didn't work, because my true curiosity was around `Haskell`, and not those other languages which are "hot" at the moment. Also, some things that are easy from a conceptual standpoint in languages like `Javascript` or `Ruby` are conceptually difficult in `Haskell`, and the reverse is true. Therefore, it is necessary to empty one's mind of expectations and just focus on gradually learning new patterns and concepts. 

(Note, before people start yelling at me: I love both `Elm` and `Elixir` in their own right. If you did learn one of those languages first and it worked for you, great! There will still be a good path for you to follow on this adventure.)

## OK, but why, specifically meditation? 

## I'm a total programming beginner, and those last two sections above made me scared
