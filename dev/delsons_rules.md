# Delson's Rules To Live By
## and how to use them with HAM

1. Efficiency of experimental design - too many experiments creates all foam and no beer.
  
  This translates to economy of code, e.g. figuring out how to get the most work done out of the fewest lines.
  Another way of saying this is code elegantly, something Haskell is reknowned for.

2. You must always have a control.
  
  A base case is a form of a control. If you don't have an intended useage for your code, there is no point in writing it.
  This may be done by writing tests or documentation.
  
3. Sometimes you must think.
  
  This one always sounds trite, but is the most important rule of all and the one most often forgotten.
  We get so wrapped up in doing things and making progress that we forget that sitting and thinking is a valid
  way of figuring out how to move forward. Meditation is contemplative and HAM should be as well. 
  If you're not pausing often to reflect, you're not doing it right.
  
4. Never touch the carpet with your bare hands.
  
  This was originally a literal instruction, but these days I use it in a metaphorical sense. 
  Touching the carpet with your bare hands is the equivalent of going to deep into something without pausing
  first to realize if there are other things you should have done first. Don't be that person.
