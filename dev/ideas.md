* Happy Learn 
  * http://www.happylearnhaskelltutorial.com/contents.html
  * Just focus on reading, exercises are boderline useless
  * Don't try to bite off more than you can chew - one lesson might be multiple sittings
  * When we start getting to example apps, try writing them yourself 
    * Set up a Cloud9 with solutions
    * Write up some unit tests? 
  * Already functional programmers, but new to Haskell
    * Take notes comparing to other functional language they know well
    * Make own koans to add to koans
* Haskell Picnic
  * http://lisperati.com/haskell/
  * Cloud9 environment
    * Stack.YAML
      * Text.Regex is stack install regex-compat (backwards compatible version of Text.Regex.Posix)
    * finished.hs whole app 
    * starting functions names file for whole app for exercise below
    * link to Regex like you're 5? 
  * Have people go through and try to figure out what each function does post tutorial
    * For library functions, look up types on Hoogle. Try to guess them first, if you think you "know" them.
    * library functions I know
    * library functions I don't know
    * tutorial functions I know
    * tutorial functions I don't know
  * Have them add doc tests
  * Picnic Koans for each lesson?
  * Don't try to understand everything going on here, just make sure to type everything out yourself
  * Will give you the process of learning about errors you might encounter bc you'll mess up and start building muscle memory
* Start out everyone with guided video meditation followed by mantra
* Encourage everyone to fork so that their journeys can be customized
* Tic Tac Toe TDD (TTTTDD)
  * Type tac toe? Must evaluate - http://chrispenner.ca/posts/type-tac-toe
  * recursive joke with T and D and string concat? 
  * how much of this is a fresh tutorial? 
  * how much of this is just type it and see what it does?
  * Check out Type Tac Toe
  * Cloud 9 environment
* Merge Dragons clone logic in haskell as TDD activity?
  * might be really good for algebraic data type
  * probably too involved and complex, but if it could be paired down? 
* Bartosz Milewski Category Theory I
  * https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I8LbkfSSR58&list=PLbgaMIhjbmEnaH_LTkxLI7FMa2HsnawM_
  * Just need to do it, he will tell you motivations
  * Take notes like it's a real course you'll be quizzed on 
  * Re-read your notes before undertaking each new lecture
  * Try to have time to watch a whole video in one sitting 
  * I find this can be watched at 1.5X speed
* H2048
  * http://taylor.fausak.me/2014/04/28/cloning-2048-in-haskell/
  * Start by just typing out and understanding the logic in the blog post
  * Make a tutorial from this or tell them go go through commit history? 
  * Use full Haskelleton or not? 
  * This could be a great TDD experience if I set it up with the Haskelleton already done for them
* Haskell School of Music
  * http://haskell.cs.yale.edu/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/HSoM.pdf
  * Great because we have one extended example for learning Haskell, instead of many contrived examples as in a regular text book
  * Free version is not the most current version of the book, but that won't matter for our purposes
  * Just read through, and don't let the music theory intimidate you
  * If an exercise question makes sense, go on and try it if you want, but don't worry if they don't
  * Figure out some other type of exercises to go with 
  * Smart phone apps for music theory
    * Mussila
    * UCLA Music Theory
* HowIStart tutorial
  * http://howistart.org/posts/haskell/1/index.html
  * Good for understanding some stuff about config
  * Bad as a beginning to Haskell
  * Good for setting up a first unit test, but won't teach TDD successfully
  * Good for establishing typical workflow and how to start a project with stack
  * Can we take some of this and couple it with the picnic tutorial instead or one of the mini-apps from Happy Learn? 
* Meditation
  * Guided meditation example
  * Reaching saturation
  * Practice Statement
  * Mantra sound?
  * Nonsense Nerd-culture Words Page "Nitwit, Blubber, Oddment, Tweak"
  * Fake Curses Page (e.g. Forking)
